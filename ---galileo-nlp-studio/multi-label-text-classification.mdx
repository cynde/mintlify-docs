# Multi Label Text Classification

[Multi-label text classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification) (MLTC), also known as multi-output text classification is a variant of the text classification problem, where multiple labels are assigned to each sample. It is a generalization of [multiclass text classification](https://github.com/rungalileo/docs/blob/main/supported-ml-use-cases/broken-reference/README.md), where a single label is assigned to each sample.

Samples are assigned a subset of the available label classes, where there are no constraints on how many classes a sample can be assigned. We refer to the set of available label classes as tasks and behind the scenes, Galileo treats assigning each class (a task) as a binary prediction problem - 1 if the given class is assigned, 0 otherwise. Here's an example:

Copy```
Input: Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.

Input: Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.

Output: Curosity, Gratitude

Output: Curosity, Gratitude





Input: That is odd.

Input: That is odd.

Output: Disappointment, Disgust
Output: Disappointment, Disgust
```
