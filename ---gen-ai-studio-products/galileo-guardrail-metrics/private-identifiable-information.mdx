# Private Identifiable Information

Understand Galileo's PII Metric

_**Definition:**_ Identify PII spans within a sample (both input and output). The current model detects the following precisely defined categories:

*   **Account Information**: account numbers, BIC and IBAN.
    
*   **Address**: must contain at least a street name and number, and may contain extra elements such as city, zip code, state, etc.
    
*   **Credit Card**: credit card number, CVV and expiration date.
    
*   **Date of Birth**: must contain a day, month and year.
    
*   **Email**.
    
*   **Name**: must contain first and last name (and optionally middle name).
    
*   **Network Information**: IPv4, IPv6 and MAC addresses.
    
*   **Personal Identification**: personal IDs not included in other categories. In particular: PIN, IMEI, VIN, VRM, Driver license.
    
*   **Password.**
    
*   **Phone Number**.
    
*   **Social Security Number (SSN)**.
    
*   **Username.**
    

_**Calculation:**_ We leverage a Small Language Model (SML) trained on proprietary datasets.

_**Usefulness:**_ Automatically identify PII occurrences in any part of the workflow (user input, chains, model output, etc), and respond accordingly by implementing guardrails or other preventative measures.

**Explainability:** To highlight which parts of the text were detected as PII, click on the üëÅÔ∏è icon next to the PII metric value. The type of PII detected along with the model's confidence will be shown on the input or output text.
