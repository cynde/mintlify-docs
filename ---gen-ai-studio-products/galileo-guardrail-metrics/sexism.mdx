# Sexism

Understand Galileo's Sexism Metric

**Definition:** Flags whether a response contains sexist content. Output is a binary classification of whether a response is sexist or not.

_**Calculation:**_ We leverage a Small Language Model (SLM) trained on open-source and internal datasets.

Our model's accuracy on the [Explainable Detection of Online Sexism](https://github.com/rewire-online/edos) dataset (open-source) is 83%.

_**Usefulness:**_ Identify responses that contain sexist comments and take preventive measures such as fine-tuning or implementing guardrails that flag responses before being served in order to prevent future occurrences.
