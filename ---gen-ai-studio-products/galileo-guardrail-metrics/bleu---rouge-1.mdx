# BLEU & ROUGE-1

Understand BLEU & ROUGE-1

_**Definition:**_ Metrics used heavily in sequence-to-sequence tasks measuring n-gram overlap between a generated response and a target output. Higher BLEU and ROUGE-1 scores equates to better overlap between the generated and target output.

_**Calculation:**_ A measure of n-gram overlap. A more lengthy explanation of BLEU provided [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/foundations-of-nlp-explained-bleu-score-and-wer-metrics-1a5ba06d812b). A more lengthy explanation of ROUGE-1 provided [here](https://medium.com/nlplanet/two-minutes-nlp-learn-the-rouge-metric-by-examples-f179cc285499). These metrics require a {target} column in your dataset.

_**Usefulness:**_ Evaluate the accuracy of model outputs in comparison to target outputs, enabling a metric to guide improvement and examination of areas where a model has trouble adhering to expected output.
