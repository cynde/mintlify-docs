# Observe

Mission-critical generative AI applications require fine-combed observability to ensure optimal performance, security checks, data leakage guardrails, cost-efficiency, and SLA compliance while gaining insights into user interactions and maintaining the quality of generated outputs in real time.

Galileo Observe helps you monitor your generative AI applications in production quickly, get alerts instantly and perform a deep root cause analysis.

Core features

**Real-time Monitoring**

Keep a close watch on your Large Language Model (LLM) applications in production. Monitor the performance, behavior, and health of your applications in real-time. Monitor SLA compliance and receive alerts for any deviations.

**Cost Tracking**

Gain insights into the costs associated with running your LLM applications. Track usage patterns and resource consumption to optimize costs.

**Guardrail Metrics**

Galileo has built a number of Guardrail Metrics to monitor the quality and safety of your models. Any metric you used during Evaluation and Experimentation in [_Prompt_](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate) can be used in Observe_:_

*   Groundedness
    
*   Uncertainty
    
*   Factuality
    
*   Tone
    
*   Toxicity
    
*   PII
    
*   And more.
