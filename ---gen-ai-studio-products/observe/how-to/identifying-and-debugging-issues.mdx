# Identifying and debugging issues

Once your monitored LLM app is up and running and you've selected your Guardrail Metrics, you can start monitoring your LLM app using Galileo.

Charts for Cost, Latency, Usage, API failures, Input/Output Tokens and any of your chosen Guardrail Metrics will appear on the _Metrics_ tab.

You can use the _Time Range_ and _Bucket Interval_ controls at the top of the screen to control what's being displayed on your screen.

Upon identifying a spike in a particular metric (e.g. a drastic dip in _Groundedness_), click and drag over the spike to filter the requests to that particular window. Then go to the _Data_ tab, to see the requests in question that caused the issue.
