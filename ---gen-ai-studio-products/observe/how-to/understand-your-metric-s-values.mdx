# Understand your metric's values

An important step towards debugging and evaluating your LLM applications is understanding your metric values and what led to them. Our metrics have explainability built-in, helping you understand which parts of the input or output are leading to certain outcomes. We have two types of explainability: Highlighting and generated Explanations.

When looking at a workflow in the expanded view, some metric values will have an üëÅÔ∏è icon next to them. Clicking on it will turn token-level highlighting on the input / output section of the node.

Explainability via Explanations

For metrics powered by [Chainpoll](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/ml-research-algorithms/chainpoll), we provide an explanation or rationale generated by LLMs. ü™Ñ next to metric values indicate that this metric has an explanation available. This explanation will include the reasoning the model followed to get to its conclusion. To view the explanation, simply hover over the metric value.

The following metrics have generated explanations:

*   [_Correctness_](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/guardrail-store/factuality)
    
*   [_Context Adherence Plus_](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/guardrail-store/context-adherence/groundedness)
    
*   [_Completeness Plus_](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/guardrail-store/completeness/completeness)
