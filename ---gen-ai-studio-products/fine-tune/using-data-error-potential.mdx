# Using Data Error Potential

It is crucial to quickly identify errors in ML training data and fix them. This is incredibly hard to do at scale when working with millions of data points.

The **Galileo Data Error Potential (DEP)** score has been built to provide a per-sample holistic data quality score to identify samples in the dataset contributing to low or high model performance, i.e., pulling the model's performance up or down respectively. In other words, the DEP score measures the potential for a "misfit" of an observation to the given model.

When fine-tuning generative models, it's useful to look at DEP at a sample level as well as at the token level. Token-level DEP can tell you exactly what parts of your Target Output your model is struggling to learn.

Sample Level DEP (top left) and Token Level DEP (highlighting)

Data Error Potential (DEP) scores are shown throughout the product. Token-level highlighting of DEP can be turned on wherever the Target Output is shown. Red indicates high DEP, orange medium DEP, and green low DEP.

**How to use DEP?**

Look for patterns in groups of High DEP samples (e.g. a High DEP cluster). A High Data Error Potential might be due to a mistake in the annotation (e.g. expecting an answer that the model couldn't possibly infer from the input), due to there not being enough "similar samples" (something the model could learn but you need to feed it more samples like it) or it simply being garbage sample which needs to be removed.

Determine whether you need to _Edit Target_ and change your Target Output, _Remove_ your samples, or Find Similar Data to include in your dataset, and [take action](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-llm-fine-tune/taking-action).
