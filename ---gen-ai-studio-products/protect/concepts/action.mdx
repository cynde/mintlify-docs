# Action

Actions are user-defined actions that are taken as a result of the [ruleset](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-protect/concepts/ruleset) being triggered. Galileo will provide a set of action types (override, passthrough), that the user can use, along with a configuration for each action type.

An Action can be defined as:

```
gp.OverrideAction(

gp.OverrideAction(

gp
.
OverrideAction
(
    choices=["Sorry, I cannot answer that question."]

    choices=["Sorry, I cannot answer that question."]

    choices
=
[
"Sorry, I cannot answer that question."
]
)
)
)
```

The action would be included in the ruleset definition as:

```
gp.Ruleset(

gp.Ruleset(

gp
.
Ruleset
(
    rules=[

    rules=[

    rules
=
[
        gp.Rule(

        gp.Rule(

        gp.
Rule
(
            metric=gp.RuleMetrics.pii,

            metric=gp.RuleMetrics.pii,

            metric
=
gp.RuleMetrics.pii,
            operator=gp.RuleOperator.contains,

            operator=gp.RuleOperator.contains,

            operator
=
gp.RuleOperator.contains,
            target_value="ssn"

            target_value="ssn"

            target_value
=
"ssn"
        ),

        ),

        ),
        gp.Rule(

        gp.Rule(

        gp.
Rule
(
            metric=gp.RuleMetrics.toxicity,

            metric=gp.RuleMetrics.toxicity,

            metric
=
gp.RuleMetrics.toxicity,
            operator=gp.RuleOperator.gt,

            operator=gp.RuleOperator.gt,

            operator
=
gp.RuleOperator.gt,
            target_value=0.8

            target_value=0.8

            target_value
=
0.8
        )

        )

        )
    ],

    ],

    ],
    action=gp.OverrideAction(

    action=gp.OverrideAction(

    action
=
gp.
OverrideAction
(
        choices=["Sorry, I cannot answer that question."]

        choices=["Sorry, I cannot answer that question."]

        choices
=
[
"Sorry, I cannot answer that question."
]
    )

    )

    )
)
)
)
```
