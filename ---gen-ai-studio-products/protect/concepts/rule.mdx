# Rule

A condition or rule you never want your application to break. It's composed of three ingredients:

*   A metric
    
*   An operator
    
*   A target value
    

Your Rules should evaluate to False for the base case, and to True for unwanted scenarios.

In the example above, the "_input/output shall never contain PII_" is encoded into a Rule like below:

Copy```
                    { 

                    { 

                        "metric": "pii",

                        "metric": "pii",

                        "operator": "contains",

                        "operator": "contains",

                        "target_value": "ssn",

                        "target_value": "ssn",

                    },
                    },
```

Or:

Copy```
gp.Rule(

gp.Rule(

gp
.
Rule
(
    metric=gp.RuleMetrics.pii,

    metric=gp.RuleMetrics.pii,

    metric
=
gp.RuleMetrics.pii,
    operator=gp.RuleOperator.contains,

    operator=gp.RuleOperator.contains,

    operator
=
gp.RuleOperator.contains,
    target_value="ssn"

    target_value="ssn"

    target_value
=
"ssn"
)
)
)
```

Rules and Metrics

Each metric requires a specific operator and target value to be compared against. An exhaustive list of metrics supported along with the operators and target values can be found [here](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-protect/how-to/supported-metrics-and-operators).

At runtime, the rule is compared with the provided payload, and the metric is computed. If all of the rules are triggered, the ruleset is triggered and the action is applied.
