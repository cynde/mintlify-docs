# Editing Centralized Stages

The following only applies to [centralized stages](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-protect/concepts/stage).

Once you've created and registered a [centralized stage](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-protect/concepts/stage#different-types-of-stages) you can continue updating your stage configuration. Your changes will immediately be reflected in any further invocations.

To update a stage, you can call <code class="py-[1px] px-1.5 min-w-[1.625rem] inline-flex justify-center items-center ring-1 ring-inset ring-dark/1 bg-dark/[0.06] rounded text-dark/8 dark:ring-light/1 dark:bg-light/1 dark:text-light/7 text-[.875em] leading-[calc(max(1.20em,1.25rem))]">gp.update_stage()</code>:
