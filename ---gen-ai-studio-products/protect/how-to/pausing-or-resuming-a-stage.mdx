# Pausing or Resuming a stage

When you're using the Galileo Protect product, once you've created a project and a stage, you can pause and resume the stage. This feature is useful when you want to temporarily stop the rulesets from being triggered without deleting them. Pausing and resuming a stage can be done for both central and local stages.

To pause a stage, you can use the following code snippet:

Copy```
import galileo_protect as gp

import galileo_protect as gp

import
 galileo_protect 
as
 gp
gp.pause_stage(project_id="<project_id>", stage_id="<stage_id>")
gp.pause_stage(project_id="<project_id>", stage_id="<stage_id>")
gp
.
pause_stage
(project_id
=
"<project_id>"
, stage_id
=
"<stage_id>"
)
```

To resume a stage, you can use the following code snippet:

Copy```
import galileo_protect as gp

import galileo_protect as gp

import
 galileo_protect 
as
 gp
gp.resume_stage(project_id="<project_id>", stage_id="<stage_id>")
gp.resume_stage(project_id="<project_id>", stage_id="<stage_id>")
gp
.
resume_stage
(project_id
=
"<project_id>"
, stage_id
=
"<stage_id>"
)
```
