# Project

What is a Galileo project?

Upon logging in to the Galileo console, you are presented with your latest [runs](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate/concepts/run).

The view upon logging in to the Galileo console

These runs sit inside of projects. Projects are a collection of runs within modules like Evaluate and Observe in Galileo. Projects are an easy way to organize multiple runs under a specific workflow, and can contain any number of runs. Projects are named upon creation, but can be renamed by editing their name inside of the project. The name of a project should reflect the goal of the project. Projects are a great way to organize and iterate your experimentation for a given goal.

To share or delete a project, first open the module it belongs to on the left panel of the Galileo console. Then, hover over the project and select either the share icon or the delete icon.
