# Experiment with Multiple Prompts

Execute prompts in bulk for faster experimentation

In Galileo, you can execute multiple prompt runs using what we call "Prompt Sweeps".

A sweep allows you to execute, in bulk, multiple LLM runs with different combinations of - prompt templates, models, data, and hyperparameters such as temperature. Prompt Sweeps allows you to battle test an LLM completion step in your workflow.

Looking to run "sweeps" on more complex systems, such as Chains, RAG, or Agents? Check out [Chain Sweeps](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate/how-to/chain-sweeps).

Prompt Sweeps for bulk execution and auto tuning
