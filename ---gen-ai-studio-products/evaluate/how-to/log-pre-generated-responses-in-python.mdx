# Log Pre-generated Responses in Python

If you already have a dataset of requests and application responses, and you want to log and evaluate these on Galileo without re-generating the responses, you can do so via our custom loggers.

First, log in via pq.login()

Copy```
import promptquality as pq

import promptquality as pq

import
 promptquality 
as
 pq
pq.login({YOUR_GALILEO_URL})
pq.login({YOUR_GALILEO_URL})
pq
.
login
({YOUR_GALILEO_URL})
```

Then, for each request/response in your eval set, construct a [node row](https://promptquality.docs.rungalileo.io/#promptquality.NodeRow):

Copy```
from promptquality import NodeType, NodeRow

from promptquality import NodeType, NodeRow

from
 promptquality 
import
 NodeType
,
 NodeRow








# Your previously generated requests & responses

# Your previously generated requests & responses

# Your previously generated requests & responses
data = [{'request': 'Say hi', 'response': 'Hi!'},

data = [{'request': 'Say hi', 'response': 'Hi!'},

data 
=
 [
{
'request'
:
 
'Say hi'
,
 
'response'
:
 
'Hi!'
},
        {'request': 'Say hey', 'response': 'Hey!'}]

        {'request': 'Say hey', 'response': 'Hey!'}]

        
{
'request'
:
 
'Say hey'
,
 
'response'
:
 
'Hey!'
}
]




rows = []

rows = []

rows 
=
 []




for d in data:

for d in data:

for
 d 
in
 data
:
    rows.append(

    rows.append(

    rows
.
append
(
        NodeRow.for_llm(

        NodeRow.for_llm(

        NodeRow.
for_llm
(
            step=0,

            step=0,

            step
=
0
,
            prompt=d['request'],

            prompt=d['request'],

            prompt
=
d[
'request'
],
            response=d['response'],

            response=d['response'],

            response
=
d[
'response'
],
            target='Hi!' #expected output optional to enable Bleu and Rouge scores

            target='Hi!' #expected output optional to enable Bleu and Rouge scores

            target
=
'Hi!'
 
#expected output optional to enable Bleu and Rouge scores
        )

        )

        )
    )

    )

    )


```

Finally, log your NodeRows to Galileo and specify the list of metrics you'd like to compute for this run:

Copy```
pq.chain_run(rows, project_name=<project-name>, scorers=[<list-of-scorers>])
pq.chain_run(rows, project_name=<project-name>, scorers=[<list-of-scorers>])
pq
.
chain_run
(rows, project_name
=<
project
-
name
>
, scorers
=
[
<
list
-
of
-
scorers
>
])
```

Once complete, this step will display the link to access the run from your Galileo Console.

See below if you're logging a RAG workflow.

### 

[](#what-is-a-noderow)

What is a **NodeRow**?

A NodeRow is an object representation of one step in your workflow. For example, in an Agent or RAG system:

*   Your retriever step would be represented by a NodeRow with the inputs that went into it and the output (chunks) that came out of it.
    
*   Your LLM step(s) would be represented by NodeRows with the prompt into the model as the input and the response from the model as the output.
    
*   An Agent or Chain node would be represented by a NodeRow, with the output of its children nodes being its output.
    

![](https://docs.rungalileo.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh7-us.googleusercontent.com%2Fslidesz%2FAGV_vUf_3RnQfE47NxmpGy6E4jVFezy_4Q5o01wX_4-0L8hZqJMyD5ygrWsXuVAgA2xNB6cvWMsVbdkDn9ekAJNasU6xYqnpqxQaBbkjvC4DOfBuwr0GiJlfLndq4I5aURio2jpCdRAn1qTxy5eHaaceBKbEc9XQ86Hl%3Ds2048%3Fkey%3DUXHJOKTJP_yWr-k5B669SQ&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=41a73677&sv=1)

To recreate a simple RAG system like the one above, you'd log the following Nodes:

1.  A NodeRow for your "Workflow" step. Because this node is the "root" of your tree, this node's ID will be the "chain\_root\_id" of every node in the tree.
    
2.  A NodeRow for your "VectorStoreRetriver" step. because the "Workflow" node is its parent, this node's chain\_id will be the ID of the "Workflow" node.
    
3.  A NodeRow for the "CustomLLM" step. Again, because the "Workflow" node is its parent, this node's chain\_id will be the ID of the "Workflow" node.
    

### 

[](#rag-workflows)

RAG workflows

To log and recreate a RAG workflow, log your retriever steps, and your LLM steps separately. This will enable Galileo to compute RAG metrics and inspect the documents or chunks returned. <strong class="font-bold">Importantly, also add both of these nodes as children of a</strong> <code class="py-[1px] px-1.5 min-w-[1.625rem] inline-flex justify-center items-center ring-1 ring-inset ring-dark/1 bg-dark/[0.06] rounded text-dark/8 dark:ring-light/1 dark:bg-light/1 dark:text-light/7 text-[.875em] leading-[calc(max(1.20em,1.25rem))]">'chain'</code> <strong class="font-bold">NodeRow.</strong>

We recommend that you randomly generate _node\_id_ and _chain\_root\_id_ (e.g. uuid()). Add the _id_ of the 'parent' node as the _chain\_root\_id_ of its children.
