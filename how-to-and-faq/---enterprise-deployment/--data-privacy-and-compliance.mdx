Incident Response, Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

Galileo has a well-defined incident response and disaster recovery policy. In the unlikely event of an incident, Galileo will:

*   Assemble response team members, including two assigned on-call engineers available at all times of day
    
*   Immediately revoke relevant access or passwords
    
*   Notify Galileo's Engineering and Customer Success Teams
    
*   Notify customers impacted of the intrusion and if/how their data was compromised
    
*   Provide a resolution timeline
    
*   Conduct an audit of systems to ascertain the source of the breach
    
*   Refine existing practices to prevent future impact and harden systems
    
*   Communicate the improvement plan to customers impacted

Compliance

Galileo provides on-going training for employees for all information security practices and policies, and maintains measures to address violations of procedures. As part of onboarding and off-boarding team members, access controls are managed to ensure those in role are only given access to what the role requires.

Galileo is SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 compliant, and therefore we adhere to the requirements of this compliance throughout the year. These include independent audit.
